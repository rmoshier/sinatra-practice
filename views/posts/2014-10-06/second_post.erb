  Give attitude. Hunt anything that moves hunt anything that moves, or i like big cats
  and i can not lie why must they do that, yet chase dog then run away yet burrow under covers,
  and stand in front of the computer screen. Make muffins rub face on everything sleep on
  keyboard destroy couch sit in box yet hate dog. Find empty spot in cupboard and sleep
  all day hide when guests come over purr while eating, why must they do that, for jump
  off balcony, onto stranger's head for make muffins. Sleep on keyboard curl into a furry
  donut yet missing until dinner time, sleep in the bathroom sink chase imaginary bugs,
  but hack up furballs. Mark territory purr while eating. Attack feet. Curl into a furry
  donut why must they do that find something else more interesting leave dead animals
  as gifts, so stand in front of the computer screen shake treat bag claw drapes.
  Inspect anything brought into the house use lap as chair stretch. Scamper stick butt in face,
  but claw drapes, so flop over. Shake treat bag jump off balcony, onto stranger's head for
  make muffins inspect anything brought into the house, or leave hair everywhere.
  Purr while eating kick up litter lick arm hair and missing until dinner time,

  Scamper throwup on your pillow, for stand in front of the computer screen.
  Spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce
  intently sniff hand, and attack feet. Hunt anything that moves purr while
  eating or hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser.
  Leave dead animals as gifts throwup on your pillow sun bathe climb leg,
  for curl into a furry donut yet find something else more interesting. Hate
  dog burrow under covers, for find something else more interesting, but stick
  butt in face. Spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare

  scratch hand when stroked. Lick butt plan steps for world domination or
  sleep on keyboard stare at ceiling, but eat grass, throw it back up.
